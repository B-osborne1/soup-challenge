# soup-challenge

This repo focuses on using beautiful soup to scrape through websites dedicated to information on Mars. There are two primary sections:

1) part 1: Mars news
This utilises a website that produces Mars based news articles. The website is parsed through to create a dictionary outlining the news titles and previews of all articles on the first page.

2) part 2: Mars weather
Similarly, this webiste parses through data on a Mars based website, however this instance looks at environmental factors located within a table. Graphs are procured from this information to analyse average monthly conditions and to roughly indicate how many terrestrial Earth days make up one year on Mars

    Output folder:
    The output folder includes the primary parsed dataframe from 'part 2' as a csv file, and all graphs from 'part 2' have been saved as png files in the 'graphs' section

Other notes:
There were two instances of using AI to assist in this work; one in each file. These have been noted as comments within the code
